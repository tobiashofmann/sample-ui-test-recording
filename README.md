# Sample UI test recording

This repository contains a sample Chrome DevTools recorder test. The test is showing how to use the recorder to capture an end user test. The sample app used to capture the test is the [SAP CAP SFLIGHT demo](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cap-sflight).

The script is used to filter the travel table for agency and travel status. A travel is selected from the result list, the detail page opened and there the booking detail is accessed.
